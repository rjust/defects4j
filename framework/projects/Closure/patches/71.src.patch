  * control restrictions indicated by JSDoc annotations, like
  * {@code @private} and {@code @deprecated}.
  *
+ * There are two parts to this pass:
+ * 1) JSDoc Inference: Attaching the appropriate JSDoc to
+ *    all programmer-defined types and properties.
+ * 2) Access Control Enforcement: Emitting warnings when the code does not
+ *    obey the restrictions attached to JSTypes in step 1.
+ *
  * Because access control restrictions are attached to type information,
- * it's important that TypedScopeCreator, TypeInference, and InferJSDocInfo
- * all run before this pass. TypedScopeCreator creates and resolves types,
- * TypeInference propagates those types across the AST, and InferJSDocInfo
- * propagates JSDoc across the types.
+ * it's important that TypeCheck runs before this pass, so that all types
+ * are correctly resolved and propagated before this pass runs.
