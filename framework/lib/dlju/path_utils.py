Taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9532499/check-whether-a-path-is-valid-in-python-without-creating-a-file-at-the-paths-ta/9532586#9532586
because apparently python neglects to provide a decent or easy way of actually
validating whether a pathname makes any sense. I don't want to know if a
path actually exists, I just want to know if the OS will throw a hissy fit
when I try to create a path.

This is windows-compatible, technically, but note that I have not in any way
designed the rest of this code to be windows-friendly.
