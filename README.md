\* Due to behavioral changes introduced in newer Java versions, some bugs are no longer
reproducible. Hence, Defects4J distinguishes between active and deprecated bugs:

- Active bugs can be accessed through `active-bugs.csv`.

- Deprecated bugs are removed from `active-bugs.csv`, but their metadata is
  retained in the project directory.

- Deprecated bugs can be accessed through `deprecated-bugs.csv`, which also
  details when and why a bug was deprecated.

We do not re-enumerate active bugs because publications using Defects4J artifacts
usually refer to bugs by their specific bug id.

The bugs
---------------
Each bug has the following properties:

- Issue filed in the corresponding issue tracker, and issue tracker identifier
  mentioned in the fixing commit message.
- Fixed in a single commit.
- Minimized: the Defects4J maintainers manually pruned out
  irrelevant changes in the commit (e.g., refactorings or feature additions).
- Fixed by modifying the source code (as opposed to configuration files,
  documentation, or test files).
- A triggering test exists that failed before the fix and passes after the fix
  -- the test failure is not random or dependent on test execution order.

The (b)uggy and (f)ixed program revisions are labelled with `<id>b` and
`<id>f`, respectively (`<id>` is an integer).

Reproducibility
================

#### Java version
All bugs have been reproduced and triggering tests verified, using
Java 11 (see the [CI configuration](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for specifics).
Using a different version of Java might result in unexpected failing tests
and/or non-reproducible bugs.

#### Timezone
Defects4J generates and executes tests in the timezone `America/Los_Angeles`.

If you are using the bugs _outside_ of the Defects4J framework, set the `TZ`
environment variable to `America/Los_Angeles` and export it.
Not setting this option results in unexpected failing tests!

#### Broken and Flaky Tests
Defects4J excludes broken tests (tests that reliably fail on the fixed and the buggy version)
and flaky tests (tests that intermittently fail on the fixed or buggy version).

If you are using the bugs _outside_ of the Defects4J framework, make sure to
verify expected test behavior for your environment.

#### Metadata
We recommend using Defects4J through the provided command-line interface. All
reproducibility tests within Defects4J rely on this interface.
If you are using the bugs _outside_ of the Defects4J framework, make sure to
use the Defects4J `export` command to obtain relevant metadata such as
source/test directories, classpath entries, and sets of tests.


Setting up Defects4J
================

Requirements
----------------
 - Java 11
 - Git >= 1.9
 - Subversion (svn) >= 1.8
 - Perl >= 5.0.12
 - `cpanm`

Defects4J version 2.x required Java 1.8.

Defects4J version 1.x and 0.x required Java 1.7.


#### Perl dependencies
All required Perl modules are listed in [cpanfile](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j/blob/master/cpanfile).
On many Unix platforms, these required Perl modules are installed by default.
The setup instructions immediately below install them if necessary.
If you do not have `cpanm` installed, use cpan or a cpan wrapper to install the perl modules listed in `cpanfile`.

Steps to set up Defects4J
----------------

1. Clone Defects4J:
    - `git clone https://github.com/rjust/defects4j`

2. Initialize Defects4J (download the project repositories and external libraries, which are not included in the git repository for size purposes and to avoid redundancies):
    - `cd defects4j`
    - `cpanm --installdeps .`
    - export PERL5LIB=~/perl5/lib/perl5/ # enable Perl to find all modules
    - `./init.sh`

3. Add Defects4J's executables to your PATH:
    - `export PATH=$PATH:"path2defects4j"/framework/bin`
    ("path2defects4j" points to the directory to which you cloned Defects4J; it
     looks like "/user/yourComputerUserName/desktop/defects4j".)

4. Check installation:
    - `defects4j info -p Lang`

On some platforms such as Windows, you might need to use `perl "fullpath"\defects4j`
where these instructions say to use `defects4j`.


Using Defects4J
================

#### Example commands
1. Get information for a specific project (commons lang):
    - `defects4j info -p Lang`

2. Get information for a specific bug (commons lang, bug 1):
    - `defects4j info -p Lang -b 1`

3. Checkout a buggy source code version (commons lang, bug 1, buggy version):
    - `defects4j checkout -p Lang -v 1b -w /tmp/lang_1_buggy`

4. Change to the working directory, compile sources and tests, and run tests:
    - `cd /tmp/lang_1_buggy`
    - `defects4j compile`
    - `defects4j test`

5. Some Defects4J commands take the project id as a command-line argument
   (possibly along with other arguments).  Examples include `info`, `checkout`,
   and `query`.  Note that `info` and `query` report information that is derived
   from the Defects4J metadata and do not require access to project files that
   are in the project's VCS.

   Other commands require a working directory, either set explicitly
   (`-w` command-line argument) or implicitly (executed from within a working
   directory).  Examples include any command that requires access to files under
   version control, including source code and build files.  This includes all
   commands that build or test the code (`compile`, `test`, `coverage`, `mutation`)
   and commands that return version-specific information (`export`).

6. The scripts in [`framework/test/`](framework/test/)
are examples of how to use Defects4J, which you might find useful
as inspiration when you are writing your own scripts that use Defects4J.

Export project-specific metadata
--------------------------------
Use `defects4j query -p <pid> -q <field_list> [-o <output_file>] [-D|-A]` 
to generate a CSV file containing a set of requested metadata for each bug 
in a specific project.

By default, `defects4j query` returns a list of active bug IDs for a project.
To request specific metadata, the `-q` flag should be provided with a 
comma-separated list of variables from the list below. For example, 
`defects4j query -p Chart -q "report.id,report.url"` will provide the a list of
all active bug IDs, along with the bug report ID and bug report URL for each.


| Property              | Description                                                                         |

| revision.date.fixed   | Date of the fixed commit for each bug                                               |
| report.id             | Bug report ID from the version tracker for each bug                                 |

| tests.trigger         | List of test methods that trigger (expose) the bug, separated by semicolons (`;`)   |
| tests.trigger.cause   | List of test methods that trigger (expose) the bug, along with the exception thrown.  Each list element has the form "methodName --> exceptionClass[: message]", and list elements are separated by semicolons (`;`) |
| deprecated.version    | (for deprecated bugs only) Version of Defects4J where a bug was deprecated          |
| deprecated.reason     | (for deprecated bugs only) Reason for deprecation                                   |

By default, `defects4j query` returns information on active bugs. The `[-D]`
flag returns information only on deprecated bugs, while the `[-A]` flag returns
information for all active and deprecated bugs.

To determine the methods that are changed between the buggy and fixed version of the code:

1. Add this line to your user-level git attributes file:
   `*.java diff=java`

2. Run `git diff --no-index`, for example `git diff --no-index /tmp/lang_1_buggy /tmp/lang_1_fixed`.
   In the output, every line starting with "@" gives the method name of a changed method.
